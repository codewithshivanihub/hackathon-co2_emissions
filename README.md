# hackathon-co2_emissions
The website explains how global warming is increasing and to take action against it. Using machine learning, carbon dioxide emission data has been analyzed to show trends in how emissions have risen over the years.

Carbon dioxide levels have impacted us greatly, from higher temperatures to worse air quality. It has been a big problem ever since industrialization began, and noticing how humanity is the cause for it, I wanted to find a way to spread the word to others so that they can help make a difference. After finding the necessary Kaggle data, I was able to visualize with a scatterplot how carbon dioxide emissions have increased rapidly since the 1800s. I was shocked to discover that there are over 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide emitted yearly, and most of that is because of our carbon footprints. Just choosing to take public transportation, carpooling, and reusing/recycling materials instead of throwing them away can make a huge difference if every one of us does it. I hope that with this website and the work I put into it, I can reveal real data and use my programming knowledge to make a model that provides future predictions that may cause people to want to take action to start addressing the problem. These little steps can all go a long way to protecting human health and the planet.
